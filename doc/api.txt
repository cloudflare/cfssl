CF-SSL API

1. OVERVIEW

The CF-SSL API allows applications to access the functionality of
CF-SSL over an unauthenticated HTTP connection. Due to the fact that
the API is currently unauthenticated, it is important to understand
that the CF-SSL API server must be running in a trusted environment.

The API currently provides endpoints for the following functions:

    1. signing (the CA will sign the certificate)
    2. bundling (the CA will return a certificate bundle)
    3. certificate validation
    4. remote certificate validation


2. ENDPOINTS

The endpoints respond to JSON-encoded POST requests. Except where
noted, the request body should be a dictionary of string keys to
string values. For example:

       {
         "key": "value",
         "key2": "value2"
       }

Responses take the form of the new CloudFlare API response format:

       {
         "result": {<certificate bundle JSON>},
         "success": true,
         "errors": [],
         "messages": [],
}

Both the "messages" and "errors" fields have the same general format:
a message or error has the form

       {
         "code:" 1234,
         "message": "Informative message."
       }

2.1 SIGNING

Endpoint: "/api/v1/cfssl/sign"
Parameters:
        * hostname: the SAN to use for the new certificate
        * cert: the PEM-encoded certificate that should be signed
        * profile (optional): the name of the signing profile to be
          used. If empty, the server's default profile will be
          selected.

Result: { "certificate": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE..." }

2.2 BUNDLING

Endpoint: "/api/v1/cfssl/bundle"
Required Parameters:

        One of the following two parameters is required; if both are
        present, the result is undefined.

        * certificate: the PEM-encoded certificate to be bundled.
        * domain: a domain name indicating a remote host to retrieve a
          certificate for.

        If the "certificate" parameter is present, the following two
        parameters are valid:

        * private_key: the PEM-encoded private key to be included with
        the bundle. This is valid only if the server is not running in
        "keyless" mode.
        * flavor: one of "ubiquitous" or "optimal", with a default
        value of "ubiquitous". A ubiquitous bundle is one that has a
        higher probability of being verified everywhere, even by
        clients using outdated or unusual trust stores.

        If the "domain" parameter is present, the following parameter
        is valid:

        * ip: the IP address of the remote host as an alternative to
        domain.

Result:

        A bundle has a number of components:

        * bundle contains the concatenated list of PEM certificates
        forming the certificate chain; this forms the actual
        bundle. The remaining parameters are additional metadata
        supporting the bundle.
        * crl_support is true if CRL information is contained in the
        certificate.
        * crt contains the original certificate the bundle is built
        from.
        * expires contains the expiration date of the certificate.
        * hostnames contains the SAN hostnames for the certificate.
        * issuer contains the X.509 issuer information for the
        certificate.
        * key contains the private key for the certificate, if one
        was presented.
        * key_size contains the size of the key in bits for the
        certificate. It will be present even if the private key wasn't
        provided because this can be determined from the public key.
        * key_type contains a textual description of the key type,
        e.g. '2048-bit RSA'.
        * ocsp contains the OCSP URLs for the certificate, if present.
        * ocsp_support will be true if the certificate supports OCSP
        revocation checking.
        * signature contains the signature type used in the
        certificate, e.g. 'SHA1WithRSA'.
        * status contains a number of elements:
          * expiring_SKIs contains the SKIs (subject key identifiers)
          for any certificates that might expire soon (within 30
          days).
          * rebundled indicates whether the server had to rebundle the
          certificate. The server will rebundle the uploaded
          certificate as needed; for example, if the certificate
          contains none of the required intermediates or a better set
          of intermediates was found. In this case, the server will
          mark rebundled as true.
          * untrusted_root_stores contains the names of any new root
          stores found while building a trust chain. New roots cannot
          be trusted while the server is running, but this might be
          useful in discovering new certificate authorities.
        * subject contains the X.509 subject identifier from the
        certificate.
