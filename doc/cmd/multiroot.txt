THE MULTIROOTCA PROGRAM

The multirootca program is an authenticated-signer-only server that is
intended to be used as a remote server for cfssl instances. The
scenario it was originally intended for is

    + running cfssl as a service on servers to generate keys
    + using multirootca as a remote signer to manage the CA keys for
      issuing certificates.

The multirootca configuration file is an ini-style configuration file;
various examples can be found in `multirootca/config/testdata`.

    [ primary ]
    private = file://testdata/server.key
    certificate = testdata/server.crt
    config = testdata/config.json
    nets = 10.0.2.1/24,172.16.3.1/24, 192.168.3.15/32
     
    [ backup ]
    private = file://testdata/server.key
    certificate = testdata/server.crt
    config = testdata/config.json
    dbconfig = testdata/db-config.json

This defines two signers, labelled "primary" and "backup". These are
both using the same key, but in practice these keys will be
different. The private key format is described below. The certificate
entry points the certificate PEM file on disk, and the config entry
points to a cfssl configuration file to use for each signer; the
format of this file is described in "cfssl.txt". Optionally, a nets
entry points to a comma-separated list of networks that should be
permitted access to the signer. This list forms a whitelist; if it's
not present, all networks are whitelisted for that signer. A dbconfig
entry points to a certdb configuration file containing database 
connection details, see `certdb/README.md`.

SPECIFYING A PRIVATE KEY

Key specification take the form of a URL. There are currently two
supported types of keys:

    + private key files: these are specified with the "file://"
      protocol. The rest of the URL should specify a path on disk
      where the key may be found.

    + rofile: these are specified with the "rofile://" protocol. The
      path should point to a file that is encrypted using Red October[1].
      If this private key type is specified, the following entries must
      also be provided:

      + ro_server: the hostname:port of the Red October server
      + ro_user: the username for the Red October server
      + ro_pass: the password for the Red October server

      Optionally:

      + ro_ca: this can be used to specify a CA roots file to override
        the system roots.
